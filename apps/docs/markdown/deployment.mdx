# Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your SaaS built with TAKEOFF, make sure to follow these steps to seamlessly bring your project to production.

## Build Command and Root Directory

We reccomend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy; however, you can deploy your SaaS to any provider that supports Next.js applications.

Make sure to configure the build script as follows:

```bash
cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --scope=<app> --include-dependencies --no-deps
```

**_Note:_** scope will be either `app` or `marketing` depending on which platform you are depoying.

You also want to make sure to specify the appropriate root directory:

- For **app**: `apps/app`
- For **marketing**: `/apps/marketing`

For more information on how to do this specifically on Vercel, see the [Vercel docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/monorepos).

## Environment Variables

Confirm that you are using the correct [environment variables](https://takeoff-docs.durk.dev/environment-variables).

**_Note:_** Make sure you are using updated values for the following:

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - your site's domain, not localhost!
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - use production API keys from your Stripe dashboard
- `STRIPE_SIGNING_SECRET` - create a Stripe Webhook and use the generated signing key
  - Tip: use your domain when giving Stripe the location of the webhook!
  - example: `https://appdomain.com/api/stripe-webhooks`
