# Project Structure

Every TAKEOFF project starts with the same project structure:

### Apps

- `app`: Your SaaS [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with a database, Stripe subscriptions, and user authentication enabled
- `marketing`: Your SaaS [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) marketing website

### Packages

- `ui`: Your SaaS React component library shared by **app** and **marketing** equipped with the design system chosen during the **create-takeoff** command

#### Turborepo

All TAKEOFF projects come built on top of [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/), a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases.
