# User Authentication

TAKEOFF handles user authentication for you. Out-of-the-box, you can use both email/password credentials and Google OAuth.

**Note:** If you get an _Access Denied_ error the first time attempting to sign up with Google's OAuth, go back to the sign up page and try again. This is an active bug; however, after trying again your Google OAuth should work perfectly.

## Adding to Authentication
