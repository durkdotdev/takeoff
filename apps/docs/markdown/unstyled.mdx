# Unstyled

Unstyled TAKEOFF projects come with all the `app`, `marketing`, and `ui` structure and features; however, are a completely unopinionated blank slate. No extra CSS Framework will be configured.

We reccomend selecting **unstyled** if you want to use traditional CSS, Saas, or another design framework.
