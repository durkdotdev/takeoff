# Scripts

TAKEOFF automatically generates some convenient scripts to use while developing:

## takeoff-init

- command: `yarn takeoff-init`
- purpose: After adding your [database environment variables](https://docs.takeoff.com/environment-variables#database), run this command to easily synch your app with your database, initliaize the database, and generate a Prisma client.

## dev

- comand: `yarn dev`
- purpose: Your development environment. Run this command to instantly start your SaaS app, marketing website, UI component library, and database inspector all at once.

## stripe-webhooks

- command: `yarn stripe-webhooks`
- purpose: Generate a [Stripe Webhook](https://stripe.com/docs/api/webhook_endpoints) mapping to your app's API. Make sure to add the secret key this command returns to your [environment variables](https://docs.takeoff.com/environment-variables#stripe) and then restart the development server.
