# create-takeoff

To create a TAKEOFF project, run the following:

```bash
npx create-takeoff
```

You will prompted for several inputs:

- `location` - relative path to where you want to create your project

  - example: ./my-app

- `ui template` - choose which CSS framework you want to use:

  - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
  - [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
  - [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - **unstyled** - A blank slate

TAKEOFF will then configure a SaaS project at your specified location configured with your CSS framework, install all dependencies, and initialize the repository.
