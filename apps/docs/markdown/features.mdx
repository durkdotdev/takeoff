# Features

TAKEOFF projects come equipped with the necessary features to build a comprehensive, fullstack, feature-rich SaaS product:

### High Quality, Annotated TypeScript/JavaScript

TAKEOFF code is written in high quality TypeScript/JavaScript. Each function is annotated with JSDoc. Each TAKEOFF project includes formatting scripts and follows best practices.

### Monorepo

Run your `app`, `marketing`, and `ui` apps and packages from one monorepo with a single command. Instead of having your codebase spread out across repositories, easily keep your SaaS code in a single repository and increase productivity.

### Rest API

Protect your app with increased security and best practices following HTTP protocol with a Rest API.

### React Frontend

Used by millions of websites and web applications, build your SaaS on top of React within TAKEOFF's high quality codebase.

### React Component Library

Create a dynamic React Component Library from your preferred CSS framework. TAKEOFF configures a `ui` package that is shared by your main app and marketing page so your SaaS has consistent and unique branding.

### User Authentication

Don't waste time reinventing the wheel, TAKEOFF handles user authentication for you. In addition, TAKEOFF provides functions to protect content from unauthenticated users or easily use a [paywall](https://takeoff-docs.durk.dev/content-protection).

### Social Logins

Out-of-the-box, all TAKEOFF projects support both email/password and Google sign ups. If you want even more social providers, simply [add their OAuth to your authentication](https://next-auth.js.org/providers).

### Password Reset

Send email notifcations with protected links to reset passwords so that your users never lose access to their account.

### Stripe and Subscription Payments

Instantly start collecting payments and getting paid. You can use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) products and subscription payments immediately with any TAKEOFF project. If you change your Stripe pricing model or product data, TAKEOFF projects instantly update.

### Dark Mode Enabled

TAKEOFF projects using Chakra UI, daisyUI, or Tailwind CSS come automatically equipped with [Dark Mode](https://takeoff-docs.durk.dev/dark-mode).
