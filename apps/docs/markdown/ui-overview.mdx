# UI Overview

`ui` is your React component library. It was automtically setup with TAKEOFF to use your CSS Framework of choice. Design components in this package can be shared among your `app` and `marketing` apps.

## What's Inside

TAKEOFF generates the following components:

## Button

- name: `Button`
- description: A simple button component

## Form

- name: `Form`
- description: A simple form component

## Input

- name: `Input`
- description: A simple input component

<br />

If you selected a CSS Framework, TAKEOFF also creates a component to manage your theme (ex. light and dark mode):

## ThemeButton

- name: `ThemeButton`
- description: A simple button, with moon and sun icons, to toggle your app's theme

## What You Can Do From Here

Expand! Further design the existing components, add more, and create beautiful styles for your SaaS branding. We reccomend using the `ui` for components if you want to share them across your `app` and `marketing` apps for better consistency.
